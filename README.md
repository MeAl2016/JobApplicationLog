# JobApplicationLog
This Visual Basic 2013 Application for keeping track of my endless USA Job Search status (in my age of 62) uses SQL Server 2014 Database with Stored Procedures, SSIS Packages. 
Records are entered/updated/displayed with one simple Visual Basic 2013 DataGridView
Windows Desktop Application.
The Tables Size is closing to thousand recods for now.
